         Housing Price Analysis <br /> Jun 2021 - Sep 2021
         <ul>
             <li>Used a Kaggle dataset to predict prices of homes in Ames, Iowa with principal component analysis and linear regression.</li>
             <li>Was able to determine that house quality had largest effect on housing price and age of house had low effect on housing price.</li>
             <li>Determined that linear regression after principal component analysis was more accurate at predicting housing price comopared to neural network.</li>
         </ul>
